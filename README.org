#+title: OriComp Planning

This repo contains all the planning for *OriComp*. This includes all past and present
issues, features, bugs, etc. (including abandoned plans).

All tracking is done through [[orgmode.org][Emacs Org Mode]].

This solution was chosen over others (like Jira or GitHub Projects) because Org Mode
is a tool that I am already familiar with. Also, since this is a one person project,
tracking issues, bugs, features, etc. across multiple users is not needed, and so
the other solutions are not necessary.
