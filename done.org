Refile done tasks so that they are not all just in this one file.

*** DONE Come Up With System for Refiling

  Done tasks (at the top level) are refiled to done.org/Archive
- State "PROG"       from "NEXT"       [2024-08-25 Sun 17:21]
- State "NEXT"       from "TODO"       [2024-08-22 Thu 21:51]
- State "TODO"       from              [2024-08-21 Wed 22:35]
:END:

Should be simple and straight-forward. Don't have to wait till toplevel task is done
in order to refile it (but maintain parent-child relationship) (maybe automatically
link parents and children)

*** CANC Automatically Refile Done Tasks

  Automatic refiling is not necessary because only the top-level tasks
  are refiled, and I do not mind refiling those tasks (they should not
  occur often).
- State "NEXT"       from "TODO"       [2024-08-22 Thu 21:51]
- State "TODO"       from "NEXT"       [2024-08-21 Wed 22:36]
- State "NEXT"       from "TODO"       [2024-08-21 Wed 21:22]
- State "TODO"       from              [2024-08-20 Tue 21:26]
:END:

This should only happen at the highest level.
